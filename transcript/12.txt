 That we had like a padding and then we put it on top because it had to like sit perfectly straight. So you can tell that's like not my ass. It's like a padding with that. But I just remember that shoot was so crazy because I was having dinner with my mom right after. And I don't I don't know. I went and worked with John Paul Goode who does like the craziest shoots. And it was one shot. And I was like – I pulled him aside and I was like, hey, like it's me. There's no publicist here. There's no one here. Like you want to shoot one, like one more? Like something other than just this one shot? And the one shot was I think the the one with the glass on my butt. But I was like, let's do something else. So he's like, okay. And he's like had to go back, sketch it out, think about it and was like, let's like rip it off or like something. And I was like, I'm down. And then I go to dinner with my mom later. She's like, how was the shoot? And I was like, oh. It was good.
