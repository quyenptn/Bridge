 You know, we talked to the team before the game, you know and this is why you come to Rutgers, right? This is this is why I would leave my alma mater as a coach to come here, is to be in these moments and to be in this environment. There's not a lot of places that um can do what we did tonight in terms of feel a building, have the energy, have the, you know the celebrity role, so to speak, and having having people want to be a part of this. So as we build, continue to work on building our culture and building our program, this is this is the type of atmosphere that we we're going to expect to have regularly. um So it was great for our our our our players to see it and experience it, especially our young players, our freshmen, Lisa, um Jill. um For those for those young players to be here and and experience that tonight, it just um gets them excited about the future of Rutgers Women's Basketball.
