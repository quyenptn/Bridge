 Oh, yes, I would be happy to. I love talking about the echo listening profile. It's probably um some of the newer listening research. It was published in 2020. And we used to think of listening styles as being more of a trait as opposed to a state. So I always listen for details. That's just who I am. But through this research that was done, what we've recognized is listening is actually a habit. And what that means is we tend to do it the same way subconsciously. And if we never learn there are other ways to do it, we just don't do it a different way. Many of us, particularly people who study communication, um but many other people, too, figure out that there are different ways to listen in different contexts, like you said. Because we not only have to look at the goal of why we're listening, but what we're going to do with that information as well
