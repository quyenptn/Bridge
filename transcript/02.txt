 It was my idea. Well, let me rephrase that. It was actually it was the fans idea. So this is something that it's Taylor Momsen's Pretty Reckless Christmas. And I'm doing the song from the Grinch. Where are you Christmas? And that was something that when I first formed the Pretty Reckless when I was 14. Every year, people put the connection together that I was Cindy Lou who in the Grinch. And every year, it got more and more exponential and more and more people, you know, put that together. And it was always kind of a funny thing that, you know, you smile at and you go, huh, that's cute. And every year, they'd go do a rock version of Where Are You Christmas? And for, I don't know, 15 years, I went, no way. Like in zero worlds, is this something I would ever do? Fast forward to it's COVID. We've gone through a lot of loss. Like it's a very hard time in the Pretty Reckless world and in my life. And there's nothing to do because we're in lockdown. And so the only thing to do is to rehearse with the band because we're all cool to be together.
