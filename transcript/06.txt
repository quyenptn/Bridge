 Hmm. Well, Hal, thanks for the quick, you know <uhm>, I reflect on that. I remember when I, when I left, when I departed Vietnam as ambassador, it's very emotional for me. You know, I moved here with my family. We were here for three and a half years. You get very invested in a place. We loved every minute of being here, you know, traveled all over the country, met so many people. I talked about developing these relationships of trust and these friendships that that was hard to, to walk away from. And, you know, you know, even officially, I was really gratified, you know, the general secretary allowed me to call on him, as did the, you know, the president, the prime minister and foreign minister and others. <uhm> And part of the reason why I think it was so meaningful to me is that, you know, I was here during the 25th anniversary of U.S.-Vietnam ties. And of course, I was here over this last week to celebrate the 30th anniversary. When when you reflect on that, it's really extraordinary what the United States and Vietnam have accomplished together.
