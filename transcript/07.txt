 For more than 40 years, we've been sold a myth that America's rich and powerful were under siege, overtaxed, overregulated, carrying the weight of the economy on their shoulders. And that if you ease up regulation on them and they prosper, the benefits will trickle down to the rest of the population. But the reality is that economic policy hasn't even remotely punished the elites in this country. It has simply rewarded them. And it's done so at the direct expense of working people. The middle class, the working class, and the working poor. Let me explain the root of the problem. According to the American Economic Policy Institute, largely because of technology, from 1979 to 2019, U.S. worker productivity grew 59.7%. That meant a worker is 59.7% more productive at their job. But that worker's reward for all that extra output is a 13.7% wage increase over the same period.
